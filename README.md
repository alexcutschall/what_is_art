              #What Is Art?

But, seriously though, what is it?

This project was created for 2 separate reasons.
 First, to help artists find inspiration. Finding a good online resource to browse through a myriad of famous artworks is difficult and often cumbersome to use. With this app, users are able to favorite their favorite artworks, look at information concerning artists, artworks, and categories of art, and to hopefully be inspired by a piece or two. On top of that, the app has a Quiz of the Day feature which will test you on how well you know famous artists and their artworks and a Quote of the Day to help with a bit of inspiration!

 Second, was to help people who find the world of art to be distant and inaccessible. Finding the time to go to a museum, pay their prices, and walk around looking at art without any context can be frustrating. This app hopes to be a point of entry for those people so that they can look around, learn about the pieces, and if they don't like that piece, they can just keep scrolling. Once they do find a piece they like, the app makes it easy to find similar artworks and to learn more about those that created the art.

This app was designed with mobile in mind so check it out on your phone if you're able to! This was a conscious decision made so that people could casually scroll through the website rather than needing their computer.
